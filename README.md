## Lesson 1 
* Access a DOM element with JavaScript
* Listen for and handle click events
* Use a anonymous function as a callback
* Dynamically create DOM elements, manipulate DOM properties, and append them to other DOM elements.
* Dynamically style DOM elements.

## Lesson 2
* Added a form to the HTML document and learned a new HTML element, the 'select' dropdown element.
* Submitted forms using the 'submit' event listener.
* Overrode default browser behavior by introducing 'event.preventDefault();'
* Retrieved data from a form element using its 'value' property.
* Used a new DOM element property, 'innerHTML', to write HTML code instead of simple text.
* Refactored the code to be reusable.
* Used simple form validation with 'if' statements to prevent user errors in the application.
* Reset the form to its default state by using the 'reset()' method on a form element.
